Building Web Applications with Angular

1.

 styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ]
})

export class AppComponent  {
 constructor(private helloService : HelloService){   
  console.log(this.helloService.sayHello());

 	 	 	FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule
16. 
How can you inject HttpClient as a dependency of an application class to consume the REST API in Angular?

 	 	 	Use the OnPush change detection strategy, which disables change detection from running on a component and its children.
11. 
While working on an Angular project, you must repeatedly import multiple pipes, components, and directives. This process requires repetitive code and your project becomes less organized. How can you avoid such issues?

16. 
A component must implement multiple styles in its host element without targeting the elements inside the host. How would you do this?
