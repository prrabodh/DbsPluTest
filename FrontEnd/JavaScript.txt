  foo = 42;  
})();
</script>

<script>  
console.log(window.foo);
</script>
 
 	 	 	42
3. 
In the following function, the this keyword has a value of undefined. Why?

function func1() {
  return this;
}
 
 	 	 	You are using strict mode in this program.
4. 
You want to use the following code snippet to emulate a private method using a closure. The code snippet is missing its return statement. Which return statement should you add where it says, "COMPLETE THE CODE SNIPPET"?

const counter = (function() {
  let privateCounter = 0;
  function changeBy(val) {
     privateCounter += val;
  }
  return {
 // COMPLETE THE CODE SNIPPET
  };
})(); counter.value();counter.increment();
 
 	 	 	increment: function() { changeBy(1); },

 	 	 	const obj = {};
6. 
You want to add a new language into the following array: 

const languages = ["Javascript", "Perl", "PHP", "TCL"];
languages.push("Python");

This appends a new language to the end, but you want Python to be the first element in this array. What change would you make? 
 
 	 	 	Use the unshift method instead of push.
7.

 	 	 	Using the class keyword and the constructor keyword as a property:
8. 
How can you define getters and setters without Object.defineProperty() on an object?
 
 	 	 	With the get and set keywords
9. 
You have a series of three promise objects. You run the following code to complete all three tasks. The code only returns a value of "promise1", which means it discarded the other two tasks. How can you change this code so that all three tasks complete?

const prom1 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 20, 'promise1'));
const prom2 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 20, 'promise2'));
const prom3 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 20, 'promise3'));

The following code takes in a number and determines the tier you belong in. All input is a valid integer between 0 and 1,000 Why does this code not run?

const tier = prompt();
if (tier <= 1000 && tier >= 800) {
  document.write("You got top tier!");
} else if (tier <= 800 && tier >= 600) {
  document.write("You got high tier!");
} else if (tier <= 600 && tier >= 400) {
} else if () {
  document.write("You got low tier!");
} else {
  document.write("You got bottom tier!");
}
 
 	 	 	There is an else if statement without a condition.
14. 
You create the following program to determine a score range based on the letter grade you receive:

const letterGrade = prompt();
switch (letterGrade) {
  case "A": 
    document.write("You got 90-100! <br>");
  case "B": 
    document.write("You got 80-89! <br>");
  case "C": 
    document.write("You got 70-79! <br>");
  case "D": 
    document.write("You got 60-69! <br>");
  default:
    document.write("You got 0-59! <br>");
}

When you input the letter "C" into this program it outputs the following:

You got 70-79!
You got 60-69!
You got 0-59! 

How can you change this code to only return, You got 70-79! as it should?
 
 	 	 	Add a break statement to the bottom of each case statement block.

function foo() {
    var a = 42;
}
 
 	 	 	The function it is declared in

var x = 0;
var y = 1;
z = 20;
console.log((z < 18) ? x : y);
 
 	 	 	if (z < 18) {
  console.log(x);
} else {
  console.log(y);
}

class MegaArray extends Array{
  constructor(contents){
    this.contents = contents;
  }
}
let mArr = new MegaArray(1, 2, 3);
 
 	 	 	The class constructor does not call super(), so this is not defined when inheriting from Array.
4.

 	 	 	To set a fallback value for your module so it is never undefined
5. 
Which steps would you take to create multiple views on the same binary data?
 
 	 	 	Create a buffer to hold the data and pass the buffer to two different types of TypedArray constructors.

    })();
  }
}
 
 	 	 	Redeclare i inside bar using var.

    end = Math.abs(end);

    const rangeIterator = {
       next: function() {
           let result;
           if (nextIndex < end) {
               result = { value: nextIndex, done: false }

           }
           return { value: nextIndex, done: true }
       }
    };
    return rangeIterator;

 	 	 	By passing in an object with the additional keys as a second argument
4. 
Which implementation of the .then() function of a Promise would result in error-free code?
 
 	 	 	myPromise.then(
);
5. 
You are working on a custom JavaScript User object for your web application. You must implement a custom iterable protocol for a collection of User objects, which should allow the web app to display information on all the users in a table. What should the collection's iterator return when called?
 
 	 	 	An iterator that is itself an iterable
6. 
How would you create a default export of a variable length, equal to 12.5 from a module?
 
 	 	 	let length;
export default length = 12.5;
7. 
Given the following function expression, how could you refactor this snippet into a named function expression?

const myFunction = function() {
    // statements
}
 
 	 	 	const myFunction = function namedFunction(){ // statements }
8. 
What static method allows the inheritance of an object's prototype in the creation of a new object?
 
 	 	 	Object.create()
9. 
A variable, originally declared with the let keyword, is re-declared in an inner block scope using the var keyword. What happens?
 
 	 	 	It generates an error.
10. 
What is the difference between using the this keyword with an arrow function and an explicit function? 
 
 	 	 	When you use this with arrow functions it does not establish a binding, which does happen with a regular function.
11. 
Which symbol must an object use to become iterable?
 
 	 	 	@@iterator
12. 
When creating a class, how can you define a method that is not accessible from an instance of that class, but instead only callable directly on the class?
 
 	 	 	Using the static keyword:

class Foo {
  static logFoo(f){
    console.log(f);
  }
}
13. 
What is one benefit of using Symbol() for unique identifiers?
 
 	 	 	Symbol() is hidden and you can keep it private for internal use.
14. 
What is a shared characteristic of both iterators and generators?
 
 	 	 	Both allow working with potentially large sequences of data in a memory efficient way
15. 
What primitive type is the variable result?

 

const result = NaN
 
 	 	 	Number
16. 
What arguments are passed to a catch block of a try...catch...finally?
 
 	 	 	The argument passed to the throw statement.
17. 
Which steps would you take to create multiple views on the same binary data?
 
 	 	 	Create a buffer to hold the data and pass the buffer to two different types of TypedArray constructors.
18. 
Given the following code, how can the function bar reuse the identifier i without affecting the value of i in foo's scope?

function foo() {
  for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    (function bar() {
      // need to use an isolated "i" here
    })();
  }
}
 
 	 	 	Redeclare i inside bar using var.
19. 
Given the following iterator, what happens if you change the flow control if statement from < to >?

function makeRangeIterator(end=Infinity) {
    let nextIndex = 0;
    end = Math.abs(end);

    const rangeIterator = {
       next: function() {
           let result;
           if (nextIndex < end) {
               result = { value: nextIndex, done: false }
               nextIndex++;
               return result;
           }
           return { value: nextIndex, done: true }
       }
    };
    return rangeIterator;
}
 
 	 	 	The iterator always returns done: true when called because the end range argument cannot be less than 0.
20. 
What boolean does the following code return?

 

Symbol("foo") !== Symbol("foo")
 
 	 	 	true
21. 
Which function type has the this keyword bound lexically?
 
 	 	 	An arrow function
22. 
What happens when you run the following code?

function func1(arg1) {
  arguments[0] = 99;
  console.log(arg1);
}

function func2(arg1) {
  arg1 = 99;
  console.log(arguments[1]);
}

func1(10);
func2(10);
 
 	 	 	You get the following output:

99
undefined
23. 
You create a new page on a website that accepts user input, stores the input into a variable input, and grabs some related data from a database. How can you take the user input in a safe and efficient manner? 
 
 	 	 	let input = prompt(<question>);
24. 
Which code snippet declares a new property called prop on obj1, defined below, that you can change with the assignment operator?

const obj1 = {};
 
 	 	 	Object.defineProperty(obj1, 'prop', {
  writable: true,
  configurable: true,
});
25. 
In the following function, the this keyword has a value of undefined. Why?

function func1() {
  return this;
}
 
 	 	 	You are using strict mode in this program.
26. 
What happens when the following code runs?

let foo = {    
  get name(){    
    return this.name;  
  },    
  set name(n){    
    this.name = n;  
  }
}
foo.name = "foo";
 
 	 	 	A recursive call to the setter causes a RangeError to be thrown because it exceeds the maximum call stack size.
27. 
You create the following array, which holds the names of the major oceans on Earth. How can you create an iterable of this array?

const oceans = ["Atlantic", "Pacific", "Indian", "Arctic", "Southern"];
 
 	 	 	const iter = oceans[Symbol.iterator]();
28. 
What is the value of the variable result?

const valueOne = "2";
const valueTwo = "2";
const result = valueOne / valueTwo;
 
 	 	 	1
29. 
What is the value of x after running the following code snippet?

let x = 0;
function foo(){
  x ^= 1;
}
foo();
foo();
foo();
 
 	 	 	1
30. 
An infinite iterator is one that never expresses true through what property?
 
 	 	 	done
