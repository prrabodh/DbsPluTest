 	 	 	Modular
2. 
You have a Ship class defined as follows:


class Ship {
  public name: string;
  public model: string;
  public goSailing() {
    console.log('Bon Voyage');
  }
}


What will happen when you run the following code:

const json = '{"name": "Jenny", "model": "Fishing Boat"}';
const ship: Ship = JSON.parse(json);
ship.goSailing();
 
 	 	 	You will get a JavaScript error that goSailing() is not defined.
3. 
Consider the following type definitions in which you have a Dog class that extends from an Animal class:

declare function feed(creature: any): boolean;
declare function feed(creature: Animal): number;
declare function feed(creature: Dog): string;

Using the above declarations, method callers failed to access the Dog method definition. How can you resolve this issue?
 
 	 	 	Change the definition of your methods as follows:

declare function feed(creature: Dog): string;
declare function feed(creature: Animal): number;
declare function feed(creature: any): boolean;
4. 
What is true of TypeScript's generated JavaScript code for class definitions?
 
 	 	 	TypeScript uses ECMAScript 6 classes when available, but also supports classes when targeting older browsers.
5. 
What belongs in an interface definition?
 
 	 	 	Members with their types, method signatures, and whether the interface extends another interface
6. 
What type of value is number in TypeScript?
 
 	 	 	Floating point
7. 
You are a quality assurance tester for a TypeScript application called mysite. You are testing specific tsconfig.json files against all .ts. files in the mydir directory. What command-line interface (CLI) compile command would you give to accomplish this?

 	 	 	let should be used whenever a variable needs to use block-scoping.
11. 
You have a new laptop and are getting ready to do TypeScript development. You already installed npm but must install TypeScript. What command should you run?
 
 	 	 	npm install -g typescript
12. 
In TypeScript, which symbol defines an optional parameter while creating a function?
 
 	 	 	?

 	 	 	Set the TSC_WATCHDIRECTORY environment variable to RecursiveDirectoryUsingFsWatchFile.
2. 
A function must call doAsync without resulting in an error. How would you define such a function with minimalistic requirements?

5. 
A Typescript file you have developed underwent a code review. The reviewers recommended that you should be using type safety within the module Which of the following lines of code best achieves this objective when importing this module?
 
 	 	 	When loading the module, use the keyword typeof.
6. 
When creating a mixin class, what should you do to extend expressions of two different mixin items?
 
 	 	 	Extend them in the target interface.
7. 
You are referencing a class named ExternalClass declared in another library. You get a compiler error when trying to run the following code: const instance = new ExternalClass(); What is one possible reason why your code might not compile?
 
 	 	 	ExternalClass is declared as abstract.
8. 
Which option causes the compiler to generate a require statement for a module?
 
 	 	 	A module identifier is only used as an expression.
9. 
You create a module named dataProc in a module file named dataProc.ts. You must use reference-elision optimization so the module is only loaded when needed. Given the following module definition, what code would only load the module when it's needed?

import { dataProc as dp } from "./dataProc";
 
 	 	 	let dataProc: typeof dp = require("./dataProc");
10.

  "typesVersions": {
    ">=3.1": { "*": ["ts3.1/*"] },
    ">=3.2": { "*": ["ts3.2/*"] }
  }
}

The file supports both TypeScript versions 3.1 and 3.2. Furthermore, if none of the versions are available, it falls back to the "./index.d.ts" file. The code in the file does not work, however. What must you change to fix it?
 
 	 	 	Arrange the "typesVersions" in the reverse order.
11. 
In TypeScript, which library works only in a JavaScript environment with a module loader?
 
 	 	 	Modular

                     propertyKey: string, 
                     descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
        console.log("step two");
    }
}

    return function (target: any, 
                     propertyKey: string, 
                     descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
        console.log("step three");
    }
}

class myclass {
    @a()
    @b()
    method() {}
}
 
 	 	 	step one
step three
step two
13.

 	 	 	let [t1, ...t2] = tpls;
14. 
You set up project references between your main library and some child projects. Individual projects work fine, but you cannot reference code from one of the children. What is the most likely reason why?
 
 	 	 	You forgot to mark the child project as composite.
15. 
Your code uses node module resolution for a file located at /root/src/moduleA.js. The file contains the import statement var x = require("./moduleB");. What does the compiler do last?
 
 	 	 	Ask the folder /root/src/moduleB if it contains a file named index.js
16. 
You receive an error after running the following class Demo:

function Foo() {
  console.log("Foo(): factory evaluated");
  return function (target: any, propertyKey: number, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
    console.log("Foo called");
  };
}

 
class Demo {
  @Foo()  
  method() {}
}

What changes must you make to display Foo called to the logs?
 
 	 	 	Use string in place of number inside the propertyKey.
17. 
What example would require using trace resolution methods to debug a module?
 
 	 	 	The compiler visits a file outside the current folder when resolving a module.

You have a Ship class defined as follows:


class Ship {
  public name: string;
  public model: string;
  public goSailing() {
    console.log('Bon Voyage');
  }
}


What will happen when you run the following code:

const json = '{"name": "Jenny", "model": "Fishing Boat"}';
const ship: Ship = JSON.parse(json);
ship.goSailing();
 
 	 	 	You will get a JavaScript error that goSailing() is not defined.
19. 
TypeScript is successfully generating JavaScript files on initial builds, but repeat runs result in errors due to duplicate class definitions. Checking your code reveals no duplicated classes. What is the most likely explanation?
 
 	 	 	TypeScript is including the generated JavaScript code because it is not explicitly excluded in your tsconfig.json file.
20. 
What is the inheritance result of using the implements keyword to create a new class in TypeScript?
 
 	 	 	The new class receives only the shape (duck typing) of the parent class.

To perform module augmentation, you import the Rock class, declare its interface in the location.ts file, and implement the class properties and method:

import { Rock } from "./land";

declare module "./land" {
  interface Rock {
    age: number;    
    shape(sh:string);
  }
}

const rk = new Rock();

rk.element = "Silicon";
rk.age = 3000;

You are referencing a class named ExternalClass declared in another library. You get a compiler error when trying to run the following code: const instance = new ExternalClass(); What is one possible reason why your code might not compile?
 
 	 	 	ExternalClass is declared as abstract.
4. 
When creating a mixin class, what should you do to extend expressions of two different mixin items?
 
 	 	 	Extend them in the target interface.
5. 
You are publishing your declaration file and populated the package.json file with the following information:

{
  "name": "linked-app",
  "version": "5.0",
  "types": "./index.d.ts",
  "typesVersions": {
    ">=3.1": { "*": ["ts3.1/*"] },
    ">=3.2": { "*": ["ts3.2/*"] }
  }
}

The file supports both TypeScript versions 3.1 and 3.2. Furthermore, if none of the versions are available, it falls back to the "./index.d.ts" file. The code in the file does not work, however. What must you change to fix it?
 
 	 	 	Arrange the "typesVersions" in the reverse order.
6. 
You create a module named dataProc in a module file named dataProc.ts. You must use reference-elision optimization so the module is only loaded when needed. Given the following module definition, what code would only load the module when it's needed?

import { dataProc as dp } from "./dataProc";
 
 	 	 	let dataProc: typeof dp = require("./dataProc");
7.

                     propertyKey: string, 
                     descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
        console.log("step two");
    }
}

function b() {
    return function (target: any, 
                     propertyKey: string, 
                     descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
        console.log("step three");
    }
}

class myclass {
    @a()
    @b()
    method() {}
}
 
 	 	 	step one
step three
step two
9. 
A function must call doAsync without resulting in an error. How would you define such a function with minimalistic requirements?

async function doAsync() {
  return 'Some long running operation should go here eventually';
}
 
 	 	 	Define the function without waiting for doAsync or using the keyword async.
10. 
You use an ambient module. What happens?
 
 	 	 	The module is automatically included in the compilation process.
11. 
Your code uses node module resolution for a file located at /root/src/moduleA.js. The file contains the import statement var x = require("./moduleB");. What does the compiler do last?
 
 	 	 	Ask the folder /root/src/moduleB if it contains a file named index.js
12. 
Which option causes the compiler to generate a require statement for a module?
 
 	 	 	A module identifier is only used as an expression.
13. 
You receive an error after running the following class Demo:

function Foo() {
  console.log("Foo(): factory evaluated");
  return function (target: any, propertyKey: number, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
    console.log("Foo called");
  };
}

 
class Demo {
  @Foo()  
  method() {}
}

What changes must you make to display Foo called to the logs?
 
 	 	 	Use string in place of number inside the propertyKey.
14. 
When are methods that return Promises evaluated?
 
 	 	 	Whenever the method is invokeked
15. 
You have a snippet of TypeScript code with method decorators and a decorator function. How can you upgrade the decorator function to return a decorator?
 
 	 	 	Create a designator factory with a decorator that passes an argument.
16. 
TypeScript is successfully generating JavaScript files on initial builds, but repeat runs result in errors due to duplicate class definitions. Checking your code reveals no duplicated classes. What is the most likely explanation?
 
 	 	 	TypeScript is including the generated JavaScript code because it is not explicitly excluded in your tsconfig.json file.
17. 
You have a Rock class saved inside the land.ts file with the following information:

export class Rock {
  element: string;

  area(feedType: string) {
    console.log(feedType);
  }
}

To perform module augmentation, you import the Rock class, declare its interface in the location.ts file, and implement the class properties and method:

import { Rock } from "./land";

declare module "./land" {
  interface Rock {
    age: number;    
    shape(sh:string);
  }
}

const rk = new Rock();

rk.element = "Silicon";
rk.age = 3000;
rk.area("New Orleans");
rk.shape("Oval");

What step did you miss?
 
 	 	 	Providing the interface's method implementation:

Rock.prototype.shape = (sh:string) => `The shape is ${sh}`
18. 
You set up project references between your main library and some child projects. Individual projects work fine, but you cannot reference code from one of the children. What is the most likely reason why?
 
 	 	 	You forgot to mark the child project as composite.
19. 
Consider the following type definitions in which you have a Dog class that extends from an Animal class:

declare function feed(creature: any): boolean;
declare function feed(creature: Animal): number;
declare function feed(creature: Dog): string;

Using the above declarations, method callers failed to access the Dog method definition. How can you resolve this issue?
 
 	 	 	Change the definition of your methods as follows:

declare function feed(creature: Dog): string;
declare function feed(creature: Animal): number;
declare function feed(creature: any): boolean;
20. 
You must get an update on the status of a file/directory using --watch. The platform does not support recursive directory watching in the node. In its default mode, the TypeScript compiler is limited by the number of watches it can create. How can you change the compiler to watch the directories and child directories with a polling watch?
 
 	 	 	Set the TSC_WATCHDIRECTORY environment variable to RecursiveDirectoryUsingFsWatchFile.
21. 
What is the inheritance result of using the implements keyword to create a new class in TypeScript?
 
 	 	 	The new class receives only the shape (duck typing) of the parent class.
22. 
What is the output of the console statement in the following TypeScript code?

enum Ball {Soccerball = 1, Baseball, Football}
let ballName: string = Ball[2];

console.log(ballName);
 
 	 	 	"Baseball"
23. 
As a TypeScript developer, you must consume the following class process from the file myclass.ts. Given the following code, which option would correctly consume the class as p within your own TypeScript?

    private current = 0;
    private memory = 0;
    private operator: string;
}
export = process
 
 	 	 	import p = require("./myclass");
24. 
Consider the following tuple elements:

let tpls: [number, number, boolean, boolean] = [39, 78, false, true];

While destructuring the above code, which code declaration will capture all four values without throwing any error or using the value undefined? 
 
 	 	 	let [t1, ...t2] = tpls;
25. 
You want to introduce project references to an existing TypeScript project. What would you add to the main project's tsconfig.json file to reference a project in the /src/utilities directory?
 
 	 	 	"references": [ 
   { "path": "/src/utilities", "composite": true }
]
26. 
You have the following two classes:

class Radio {
  public isOn: boolean;
  public name = 'Radio';
}
class Television {
  public isOn: boolean;
  public name = 'Television';
}

What is the result of the following code?

const mediaSource: Radio = new Television();
console.log(mediaSource.name);
 
 	 	 	"Television" appears in the console log.
27. 
Which TypeScript compiler flag would you use to list the files names used during compilation?

 	 	 	/// <reference path = "aModule.d.ts" />
30. 
Your teammate is referencing a .d.ts file for each of his modules. Instead of defining each module in its own .d.ts file with top-level export declarations, how else can he simplify the module design for easier importing?
 
 	 	 	Create one larger .d.ts file and use the module keyword and the quoted name of the module.

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() { console.log(i); }, 100 * i);
}

How would you modify the code while using the existing code features to arrive at 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9?
 
 	 	 	for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    (function(index) {
        setTimeout(function() { console.log(index); }, 100 * index);
    })(i);
}

When executing --watch, what does the compiler rely on that the node provides?
 
 	 	 	fs.watch and fs.watchFile
VM862:43 4. 
You want to invoke a method that returns a result. Once the result is returned due to a promise being resolved, you would like to log the result, log an error if one occurred, and then display a final message, regardless of the outcome. What code would you write to do this?
 
 	 	 	this.doSomething()
   .then(r => console.log(r))
   .catch(e => console.error(e))
